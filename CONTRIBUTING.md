Contributing to SMCP
====================

First, thanks for considering contributing to SMCP!

In general, there are three types of direct contributions to the project:

1.  [Indirect Contributions](#indirect-contributions) (Bug Reports and
    Feature Requests)
2.  [Trivial Direct Contributions](#trivial-direct-contributions)
3.  [Substantial Direct Contributions](#substantial-direct-contributions)

## Indirect Contributions ##

Anyone may file a bug report or a feature request to the [SMCP Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/darconeous/smcp/issues).

By submitting a feature request (particularly for novel features), you
agree to not assert any patent or copyright infringement claims against
the authors or users of the project for implementing the feature you
requested.

## Trivial Direct Contributions ##

You make a trivial direct contribution when you file a pull request against
the project that addresses any of the following sorts of issues:

*   Misspellings
*   Syntax errors
*   Typos
*   Logic errors where the intended correct behavior was obvious
*   Trivial platform build fixes
*   Code style and whitespace corrections

These are the sorts of issues where, if you had filed a bug, the official
developer would have solved it in exactly the same manner. More explicitly,
if the change could be considered creative in any possible capacity, it is
not a "Trivial Direct Contribution".

When you submit such a pull request, you are agreeing to make no claim of
copyright over the affected code. We allow for such pull requests because
it is a convenient way to track and provide attribution for such fixes
in release notes.

If this policy is unacceptable, please do not file a pull request for
trivial changes and instead [file a issue][1] so that one of the official
developers address the problem instead.

## Substantial Direct Contributions ##

You make a substantial direct contribution when you file a pull request
against SMCP that would be considered any of the following:

*   Implementing a new feature
*   Rewriting a paragraph to improve clarity
*   Fixing a non-trivial bug
*   Any change that could be considered to be creative

By making such a contribution, you assert the following:

1.  You wrote these changes in their entirety.
2.  You hold the copyright to the changes.
3.  You agree to forever permit the changes to be distributed under the
    terms of the project's [open-source license](./LICENSE).
4.  To the best of your knowledge, there are no legal impediments to
    including the changes into the master branch of the project.

When making a substantial direct contribution, you may optionally update
the Copyright notice to reflect your contribution. When your contribution
includes an entirely new file, you should update the copyright line in the
license boilerplate to indicate copyright holder's name.
